== Camel FTP Example with Spring Boot

A very simple example which demonstrates the Camel FTPComponent and JMSComponent based camel route as
a Spring Boot Application

=== Setup and Running

To make this application run we need to setup a small FTP server, the source folder has a Vagrantfile which
can be used to spinup small CentOS server which will serve as a FTP server for this demo.  Use the command
`vagrant up` from the source folder to start he server and setup a sample FTP folder called `orders` with
some example files, the vagrant sync is already setup, so you can add the files to the orders folder in the
source tree to see it synched with Vagrant box under `/home/vagrant/orders` which will be used by the Camel
FTP component

Once the FTP server is up you can run the application using `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the Camel route
and start processing the files FTP server
